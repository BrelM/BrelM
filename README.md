Hi, I’m Brel👋🏽
I’m interested in back-end programmers work.
My main goal's to become a mecatronics/robotics engineer so, I'm on my way to master low level system technologies at least for now.
I'm mainly a Python developer. But I do use C/C++, JS and HTML5/CSS3 in my daily projects.
I’m looking to collaborate on some projects
(big or little) to keep on leveling up and so earn from my work asap😅.
