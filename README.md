Hi, I’m Brel👋🏽\
I’m mostly interested in back-end technologies.\
My main goal's to become a mechatronics/robotics engineer so, I'm on my way to master low-level system technologies.\
I'm mainly a Python/C/C++ developper but, I do use other programming languages such as Java, JS, R, HTML5 and CSS3 in my daily projects.\
I’m looking forward to collaborate on some projects (big or small) to keep on leveling up and contribute in something meaningful.\
You can reach out to me using this address brelmbe@gmail.com.
