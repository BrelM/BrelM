Hi, I’m Brel👋🏽
I’m interested in back-end programmers work.
My main goal's to become a mecatronician or robotician so I'm on my way to master low level system technologies at least for now.
I'm currently trying as much as I can to master C++. But I do use C, Python and HTML5/CSS3 as usually as possible in my daily projects.
I’m looking to collaborate on some projects
(big or little) to keep on leveling up and so earn from my work asap😅.
You can reach me using this address brelmbe@gmail.com.
